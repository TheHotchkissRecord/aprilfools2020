Theatre student Jack McGlinn ’22 has discovered a new outlet in the arts as he practices social distancing in his hometown of Seattle, Washington. As part of the practice of his craft, McGlinn has been working on reproducing the work of master artists and has produced an incredibly lifelike sketch of the Arnolfini Portrait by Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck (pictured below). He attributes his impressively realistic rendering of the original painting to approximately five minutes of hard work with No. 2 mechanical pencils and sharpies and slight touches of Crayola to accentuate the colors. “I love [visual] art,” he said. “[Visual] art is fun.”
