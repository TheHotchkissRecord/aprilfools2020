It is no secret that many Prep and Lower Mid students turn to their older friends for Senior wifi, which allows them to access the internet at any time they like. However, in a shocking turn of events, it was revealed during lunchtime on Thursday, March 5 that a Senior has been using Prep wifi since the beginning of the second semester. Mr. Roger Wistar, director of the Annual Pick-the-Oscars Competition, revealed the information in an especially sombre article on the school website.
