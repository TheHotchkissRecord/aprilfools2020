To the demand of students across thousands of classes, Night-Golfing has been officially named as a co-curricular for the fall and spring seasons. Night-golfing is a more intense version of conventional golf that holds its practice from 8 pm to 10 pm on weekdays, and 8 pm to 11 pm on Saturdays. The flexibility of the games appeals to students – the games can vary among players and occasions. Despite this, the activity is not to be taken lightly. A seasoned night-golfer, who wishes to remain anonymous, explained, “It requires a much higher level of depth perception than regular golf. You also need a lot of guts, determination, as well as a desire to have fun and engage in the games. Some people just don’t have what it takes.”
