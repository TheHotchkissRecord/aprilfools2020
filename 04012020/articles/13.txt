This Saturday, Christian Gallaher ’22 will travel to Jupiter to compete in the first annual Interplanetary Crossfit Games, along with the first-, third-, and fourth-fittest teens on Earth. As a member of Winter Team Training, Gallaher has been working all season to prepare to face off against teens from across the solar system. He said, “One of the challenges is that I have no idea what my competition looks like. Usually, I’m familiar with who I’m competing against, but I’ve heard from astronomers that the teens at Saturn could be up to three times my size.”
