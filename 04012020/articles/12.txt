Content preview: 
Cooper Roh ’22 is a two year Lower Mid, captain of the Quizbowl team, and a strong supporter for Varsity non-athletes at Hotchkiss. Whether exercising his thumbs for the buzzer or practicing social distancing from the MAC, he shows consistent engagement in purely non-athletic activities at Hotchkiss. Aside from Quizbowl competitions, he can also be found on Fairfield Farm participating in FFEAT during the Fall and Spring seasons, picking potatoes, or simply laughing and reflecting with friends. Teammate Huck Whittemore ’22 said, “Cooper has more photos of historical figures hanging in his room than he has pieces of athletic clothing in his closet.”
